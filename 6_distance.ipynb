    "The distance metric represents the distance between two points $x$ and $y$. A point in $n$-dimensional space can be represented by a vector of length $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of applications of distance metrics:\n",
    "- k-nearest neighbors algorithm: to calculate the k points that are closest to the new unlabelled point.\n",
    "- Clustering algorithms: to calculate the distance between records inside the cluster and to calculate the distance between different clusters. For example, k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some frequently used distance metrics include:\n",
    "- Euclidean distance: $$D_{euc}(x, y) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-y_{i})^2\\right)^{0.5}$$\n",
    "- Manhattan distance: $$D_{manh}(x, y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} abs(x_{i}-y_{i})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, distance metrics satisfy some properties such as:\n",
    "- The distance between two points is non-negative. \n",
    "- The distance from a point to the point itself is equal to 0. \n",
    "- The distance from point $i$ to point $j$ is exactly equal to the distance from point $j$ to point $i$ (symmetry). \n",
    "- The distance from point $i$ to point $j$ via point $k$ is always longer or equal than the direct distance from $i$ to $j$ (triangle inequality). "
