    "   - the dictionary mapping words to indices (as computed by the function `word_index` above).\n",
    "   - the `dok_matrix` which counts how many times each word occurs in each text. The matrix should be $M\\times N$, where $M$ is the number of texts and  $N$ is the total number word types (i.e. total number of unique words). In your implementation you will use the function `word_index` to map words to indices.\n",
